# DM Sans Offline Fonts

Download these two files from Google Fonts and place them here:

1. DMSans.woff2        — Variable font (wght 300–700, normal)
2. DMSans-Italic.woff2 — Variable font (wght 400, italic)

Download URL:
  https://fonts.google.com/specimen/DM+Sans
  → Click "Download family" → extract the woff2 files

Without these files the app uses Roboto/Google Sans (Android system fonts),
which looks great but is slightly different from the web version.
